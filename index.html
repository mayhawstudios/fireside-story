        <P>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>A man in a trenchcoat walks down an alley when he encounters a stray cat... The cat meows.</p>
        <p>The man goes to pet the stray cat.  Suddenly, the cat hisses and pulls out a laser pointer!</p>
        <h1>The cat blasts the laser pointer into the man's eyes, temporarily blinding the man. The cat dashes off with the man's wallet.</h1>
